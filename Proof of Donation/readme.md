# 1. Proof of Donation

## Descrition

The idea is to distribute the wealth equally between the people who have little to their names. The miner is the person with most donated coins, and there is a fixed amount of mining reward in the start. The miner obviously will have a lot of coins at this point. Before the mining of the next block, the miner must choose an amount of coins that he must donate to everyone else equally in the chain. This amount(donation amount) will be the base of choosing the next miner. Anyone can donate any amount to the network and the person who donates the most will be chosen as the miner.

## Pros

1. Everyone can contribute in this consensus algorithm
2. Donation equalizes the power to all the people. A person who doesn’t do anything will also keep on increasing its worth, but it won’t be a significant amount. However, he can buy more coins and donate to become a miner(the mining reward is obviously more than he donates)
3. It stabilizes the worth of the coin too

## How it works

At the start of the mining, everyone will be asked how much they want to donate. The person who donates the most will be chosen as the miner. The donated amount will be distributed evenly between all people of the blockchain. The power will be balanced, and no side will have all the power as the donated amount is distributed evenly.
