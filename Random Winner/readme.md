# 2. Random Winner

## Idea

Random winner with specified prize pools of a certain minimum and maximum amount, winner gets 50% and the rest is divided to the contributors in the proportion they contributed.

## Description

We will make a random prize pool; anyone can give any amount with a certain range, e.g. 5-10 Coins or 50-100 Coins
The person who will be selected as miner randomly will get 50% of the prize pool. The rest of the 50% will be divided to the rest of the person who were involved in the pool. The proportion of the division will depend on the amount the person gave. This way no one will be left with zero, everyone will get something in the percentage they gave. The poor will get a chance to step up their game little by little.

## Pros

1. Everyone can contribute in this consensus algorithm
2. Adds an exciting way to balance the power by helping everyone equally regardless of them being poor or rich
3. It is a gamble of your power(stake) but most people will be up for it.
4. There will be no nothing-at-stake attack

## How it works

We will have different pools with different range of entry ticket price.
E.g. A prize pool with entries ranging from 50-100 Coins, or a prize pool entry ranging from 5-10 Coins.
50% of the prize money will be sent to the selected miner, and the rest will be divided as per the following example:
Suppose A,B,C takes part in a mining queue which has the minimum entry of 10 Coins and max entry for 20 Coins. A gives 15 Coins, B gives 15 Coins and C gives 20 Coins. The total prize money is hence 50 Coins. After a certain amount of time(the time declared by us after which a block will be mined) a random winner will be decided, suppose C. C will get 25 Coins (50% of the prize pool) The rest of the 25 will be divided equally to A and B as they both gave same amounts. Both the parties will be given 12.5 Coins.
